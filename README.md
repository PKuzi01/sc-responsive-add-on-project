I learned that there are things I would much prefer to use. But it was nice to polish up on my css skills. I also think I have acquired a taste for styling. Maybe web design might be well within my sights? I loved doing the research for the fonts and the colours. A good practice run. Note to self: *IT"S NOT A TYLER PAGE WITHOUT THE FONTS!!! IT'S NEVER IS!!!*.
