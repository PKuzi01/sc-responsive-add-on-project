                                The classic Kanye production? The bars? Dude come on. But more importantly, it's one of those songs that you can sigh in hope to, uno? A sigh of grounding assurance. "I'm making it out" type beat.

                                It is probably the best way I've ever heard anyone begin an album. The best way. And I love a lot of intro's to albums. The hazing discordant noise is the best part. It's also my favourite of his albums so I'm defintely biased.

                                First: FRAAAAAAANK *sobs*. Second, I relate a little too much to the second part of the song. Third, head bop. I appreciate a good, wholesome, hearty head bop. A cute head bop means so much to me. Means my head is clear enough to stay present. Love it.

                        It's a cool concept no? But it's mainly to develop my coding skills, uno? I'm working toward being the sickest web developer in the game. And practice makes perfect. It's <a href="https://github.com/PKuzi01/sc-responsive-add-on-project" target="_blank">open-sourced</a> though.
